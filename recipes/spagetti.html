      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        I got this recipe 30-plus years ago from a neighbor's mother who lived
        in Italy. It is delicious and always well received. Sub all or part of
        the ground beef and sausage for turkey or chicken products to lighten
        the recipe.

          <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Heat tomato puree in a large pot over medium-low heat; simmer
              while prepared the remaining ingredients.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heat a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir hot Italian
              sausage, mild Italian sausage, and ground chuck until browned and
              cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
              Remove cooked sausage and chuck with a slotted spoon and transfer
              to the simmering tomato puree.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cook and stir onion and garlic in the same skillet used for
              browning meat until onions are lightly browned, 5 to 8 minutes.
              Transfer onion mixture to meat mixture.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stir water and tomato paste in the same skillet used for onion
              mixture over low heat until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes;
              add to the sauce in the pot. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese, basil,
              oregano, and parsley over the sauce; stir to combine. Simmer over
              low heat, stirring occasionally, for 3 hours.
            </li>
